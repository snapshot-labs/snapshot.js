## Impossible Finance Governance Strategy

This strategy makes calls to check balances of IF and IF-X LP tokens associated with input addresses. For IF-X LP tokens, the strategy is able to calculate how much IF underlying should be associated with that LP token. We are also able to assign weights to tokens from LP tokens to allow stakeholders that are aligned with our ecosystem to have more voting power.

Note that STAX tokens and STAX-X LP tokens have no voting power with this strategy.
