## Explanation
This strategy just gets the amount of KEEP that an address has staked in the operators that it owns.

## Parameters
This strategy doesn't take any parameters.

## Testing
The numbers can be cross-checked against [All The Keeps](https://allthekeeps.com/operators).

## Notes
Some of the addresses provided in `examples.json` don't have any operators associated with them and thus don't have any staked KEEP.
