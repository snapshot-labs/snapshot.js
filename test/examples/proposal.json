It will still be used for small general expenses, bounties, on-boarding new contributors before voting on part or full time compensation, marketing campaign costs, etc.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nHere’s a full reconciliation of all distributions from general expense fund from 1.29.2021 to 4.30.2021\n![Foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/b9cdeb68a8af90725805291c90dd129ea8b52b3d.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe general expense fund would be responsible for: \nYam infrastructure expenses\nNew Contributor trials / on-boarding\nDevelopment / collaborative tools \nGas costs\nSmall misc expenses directly related to Yam\nIf it is possible to pay in $YAM, then it should be the first option. \nWhen funds are low in the account, a top-up request for additional funds will be made. \n",
